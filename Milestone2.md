### Project Goals

### Core Visualization

Our minimal viable product includes 3 different visualizations linked with each other: portrait view, ensemble view and statistical view.

The sketches for the portrait view of our visualization are presented below. The idea is to create a "memorial" of each victim. The schematic representation can be seen in Portrait View 1: name of the victim is in the center of the circle, with a picture of the victim if it is present in the dataset. The selected year is shown as a large circle (for now we have only data for 2018, if we get more data, a feature to select year will be added to the page). The date of death is placed on this circle and the position is based on the date. A symbol next to the death date denotes the cause of death. Smaller circles show the age of the woman: number of circles corresponds to the number of years. In the right upper corner name of the state is written inside the contour that has a shape of this state on the map. In the left upper corner the information about victim's race/ethnicity is shown (each circle is a race/ethnicity). Portrait View 2 shows another possible way of presenting this information (the race is in a "constellation" design). Portrait View 3 and Portrait View 4 demonstrate other design ideas for the age and year visualization (age is shown as ticks or rays and year is divided into months).
