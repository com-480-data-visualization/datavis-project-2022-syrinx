To see the website, first download the data.csv file from our [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fdk4ubsOctuRFj3aY4pa1Y2Azvg_L48U/view?usp=sharing) (access is limited to the professor and the teaching assistants of the Data Visualization course) and put it in the directory `page/data`. Then run from the `page` directory: 
```
python -m http.server 9000
```
And after that go to the page http://localhost:9000/ in your browser (we checked it for Google Chrome, Firefox and Brave).
