			<h1> Femicide in the United States of America in 2018 </h1>
		</div>
		<div class="skeleton"  >
			<p>
			  Femicide or feminicide refers to gender-based killings of women and girls.
				This website was created to provide an interactive visualization
				of the dataset that contains information about the cases of femicide in the USA in 2018.
				It is a subset of a larger dataset that has been manually collected and cleaned up by Dawn Wilcox
				with input from public contributors. It can be found on the official website of
				the <a href="https://womencountusa.org/the-databases" >Women Count USA: Femicide Accountability Project</a>.
				The main goals of this website are to honor the memory of these girls and women by creating a space for their names and stories and to draw people's attention to the problem of femicide by providing the statistical data.
      </p>
			<p>
				Our visualization includes the three following views on the data we want to present: ensemble view, portrait view and statistical view.
      </p>
			<p>
        The ensemble view is what you can see below when you first visit our webpage. There are 1840 circles of different colors and each circle corresponds to a particular case of femicide committed in the USA in 2018. Color of the circle represents a race or ethnicity of the victim. To see which color represents which race or ethnicity, you can move to the lower part of the page and click on the Race/Ethnicity button. New buttons will appear with the names of different races and ethnicities present in the dataset, by clicking on them you can sort the data displayed in the ensemble view, so the cases for the selected category will always move to the top. You can also sort the circles by two other criteria: the State where the crime was committed or the Relationship with the aggressor. If you click on the Toggle Statistics button, it will send you to the statistical view. The main idea of the ensemble view is that you can select each circle and learn more about the woman to whom it is dedicated. So, if you click on one of the circles and press the button for a few seconds a large circle with a name of the victim in the cente will appear. You can also notice several thin circles around the name, the number of these circles actually corresponds to the age of this woman. Double click on the small circle will send you to the portrait view. We leave some space below for possible new entries that haven't been added to the database yet.
      </p>
			<p>
        The portrait view is a page where you can find more information about the woman that was killed. You can again see her name and age in the centre of the circle. In addition, you can see the date of death indicated on a large circle. In the left upper corner the race or ethnicity of the victim is displayed, and in the upper right corner there is an image representing the state where the woman was at the time of murder. The Explore button allows you to switch to other portrait view pages, which can provide you with information about other victims. The buttons Ensemble view and Statistical view are made for navigation between different views included in our visualization.
      </p>
			<p>
				The statistical view demonstates the results of data aggregation and makes it possible to compare the distributions of victim’s and killer’s ages and races. Moreover, you can also see the plot for the distribution of various kinds of relationship a woman had with a suspected/murderer. You can choose a category for which you want to see the distribution by clicking on the buttons under the plots. The plot representing women’s data is always on the left side of the page and the plot showing men’s data is on the right side of the page. That’s why, for the Relationship attribute there is only one plot on the right telling about a role an aggressor played in a victim’s life. As for the Race and Age distributions, you can notice that they are quite symmetrical. In the relationship plot you can see that most of the affected women were in romantic relationship with the killer, and we want to highlight this fact to raise public awareness.

				Thank you for visiting our website, we hope that you learned more about the problem of femicide and that you will share this webpage with other people.
